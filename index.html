        <h2>First steps in coding</h2>
        <!--
        <p>This is my first attempt at coding a website. It's not perfect, but I'm having fun.</p>
        <p>Here's how my coding journey has been so far:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I completed the Ruby track on Codecademy. It was my first coding experience <strong>ever</strong> and it took me around 40h to complete, but I'm glad I took my time; I can already tell it was a solid foundation.</li>
            <li>I went into the basics of web development and started a bootcamp with Frontend Masters, an introduction to HTML, CSS and Javascript. If I'm making this website now, it's because this bootcamp taught me good stuff. </li>
            <li>I got accepted to ReDI School in Munich to study Introduction to Computer Science, to bridge all conceptual gaps between my original formation and programming.</li>
            <li>Next stop: Le Wagon, a 9-week, super intensive, immersive coding bootcamp that will take me from beginner and give me all tools necessary to fight for my first IT-job. Lemme tell ya, summer of 2022 will  be a busy time for me.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>My past life</h2>
            <p>I've been around for a while, my journey in life definitely did not start yesterday. Here's some of the stuff I did before coding became my next big thing. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Went to college for Communications and earned a Bachelor's degree in Publishing at UFRJ, one of the best universities in Brazil.</li>
                    <li>Worked at Sextante, one of Brazil's top publishing houses, and made my way from Intern to Acquiring Editor (for those not in the know, one of the most coveted positions in Publishing).</li>
                    <li>Got a specialist degree in Translation (PUC-Rio) and built a successful freelancing career, translating books and localizing videogames.</li>
                    <li>Started a translation/education startup with three other friends and turned it into a thriving business. I'm no longer with the company, but you can check them out <a href="http://apretexto.com.br" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                    <li>Had many interesting side gigs in life, such as photographer at a ski resort in the USA, wedding photographer, English teacher, audiobook director, ghost writer, interpreter and hostess in literary events.</li>
                    <li>Sold everything I owned, gave up my apartment and moved to Germany during a pandemic from a non-EU country with two cats in tow. I managed the whole thing as one smooth process, navigating entry restrictions and rules that changed every week, and if that doesn't tell you <strong>a lot</strong> about my organization skills and resilience, nothing else will.</li>
                </ul>

        <p>Cats are the lifeblood of the internet, and I'll use some pictures of my "living room tigers" to showcase some cool Javascript.</p>
